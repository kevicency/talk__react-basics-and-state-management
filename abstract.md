## Talk

> An Introduction to React and State Management

In this talk we'll explore the fundamentals of React and the ideas behind its design by implementing our own version of React from scratch and compare it to other popular web frameworks. In the second part of the talk we'll dive deeper into the topic of State Management in React applications. We'll talk about the different types of state living inside an application as well as the different ways to manage them via tools provided directly by React and third-party libraries.
