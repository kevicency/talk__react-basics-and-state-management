# Part 2: State in React

The most important thing about managning state
is to know with what kind of state you are dealing with!

+------------------+-------------------------
|                  |                        |
|    *UI State*    |      *App State*       |
|        |         |       /       \        |
|        |         |      /         \       |
|        v         |     /           \      |
|   *Components*   |  *Client*    *Server*  |
|                  |                        |
+------------------+---------+--------------+
|                            |              |
| React Hooks        Redux   | React-Query  |
| React.useContext   Mobx    | useSWR       |
| React.useState     Zustand | Apollo       |
| React.useReducer   ...     | ...          |
|                            |              |

Libs for Cient State can also be used for managing
Server State but it requires a lot of boilerplate code.
